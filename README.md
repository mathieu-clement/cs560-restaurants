## Build

Get an API KEY from Yelp, and save it to a file named `.YELP_API_KEY`. Then fetch data from Yelp using `fetch.py`, which yields the file `yelp.json`, and combine it with the SF Health Score department database using `combine.py`, which produces `combined.json`.

## Test

To run unit tests, simply launch:

    nosetests

Nose will read its settings from `setup.cfg`.
