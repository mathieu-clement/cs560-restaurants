## Build

Install the distance Python library from PyPI:

    pip3 install distance

It is used to perform fuzzy matching of strings, e.g. by using the Levenshtein edit distance algorithm.

Get an API KEY from Yelp, and save it to a file named `.YELP_API_KEY`. Then fetch data from Yelp using `fetch.py`, which yields the file `yelp.json`, and combine it with the SF Health Score department database using `combine.py`, which produces `combined.json`.

## Test

To run unit tests, simply launch:

    nosetests

Nose will read its settings from `setup.cfg`.

## Run
